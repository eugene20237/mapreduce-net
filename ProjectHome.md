# MapReduce.NET #
### The easy to use, multiplatform (.NET & Mono) MapReduce framework ###

An easy to use, everyday MapReduce.NET framework. If you do not have thousands of servers and petabytes of data but would love to automatize distributed data processing, MapReduce.NET is for you.
MapReduce.NET is ideal for log file parsing, data mining, product recommendation generation, and even distributed image processing.
With a built-in web server, the worker nodes can publish their statuses to the controller node and operators for and easy overview.

To kickstart, download the source and have a look at a simple example: [Grep distributed search sample](Grep.md)

[Hands-on lab available](http://bit.ly/mapreduce-intro-lab) - an activity statistics and churning customer detection sample.

If you want to know how to load or save date, read the [Input output plugins](Plugins.md) article.

To see what classes needs to be defined, read a bit more about [base classes in MapReduce.NET](Baseclasses.md)

To get started with MapReduce in general, read the [MapReduce.NET presentation slides](http://www.slideshare.net/adamhorvath/mapreduce-frameworks-and-methods-adam-horvath-google-technology-user-group-sydney)
